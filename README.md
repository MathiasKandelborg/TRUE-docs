## TRUE Framework === The Really Unique & Exciting Framework

Built on the shoulders of giants. Made to Just Work‚Ñ¢ and follow specifications

TRUE is an opinionated starter kit based on technologies that seek to be:

- Efficient
- Have incredible user _and_ developer experience
- Be feature-full (without all the bloat)

## Reasoning

A good starter kit reduces time spent solving problems, and improves the concept --> idea process.

When you start a project, it can be daunting to get everything right.
If one wants to have contributors, linting, versioning and other things, it would have to be implemented 'from the bottom'.

It is rarely the case that a project would have requirements that differ so much from the 'default' most people (want to) set up;
that's why it's often sensible to begin from a foundation instead of creating - and thereby re-thinking - what's essentially being created every time a new project is made.

In order to _apply and test_ ideas instead of **building** them, one should start from a flexible place that isn't too restrictive, but still get a lot of utility going without further thought.

For a starter kit with a lot of default utility and pre-made boilerplate, it's almost impossible to keep opinions away. This framework is opinionated and has to be in order to stay flexible, sleek and ready for large amounts of contributions.

## Who would use this

Mathias (the creator) is going to use this for all his website/app based projects.

Anyone who wants an easy time coding websites using NextJS, Sanity(CMS), Material-UI, Framer-motion and be able to do whatever they want in React.

## License

Anyone can do anything they want; it's their responsibility, however.
